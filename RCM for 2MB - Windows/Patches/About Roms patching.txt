44-48kB Roms:

 You have to apply a patch to 44-48kB roms that you want put in your
 compilation.
 The patch consists of removing the swithing slot on the page 8000h-BFFFh.
 Only roms that use 8-16kB RAM can be be patched to add to your compilations.
 And to run they require 32kB RAM when patched.

 Example to remove the slot selection routine:
 
 Replace 26 80 CD 24 00 by 26 80 00 00 00 in the Rom file.

 Sometimes there is C3 instead of CD. If you don't find out any CD 24 00 or
 C3 24 00, it is because the slot switching is done by direct access.


Note: 64kB plain Roms can't work because of the SCC mapper which is not
      suitable.
